# Semi-SDP
Semi-supervised parser for semantic dependency parsing.

This repo contains the code used for the semi-supervised semantic dependency parser in Jia et al. (2020), https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.607.pdf. 
Part of the codebase is extended from https://github.com/tdozat/Parser-v3.
