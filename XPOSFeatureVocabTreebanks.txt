# When training these treebanks as taggers, include --TaggerNetwork output_vocab_classes=UPOSTokenVocab:XPOSFeatureVocab:UFeatsFeatureVocab
# When training these treebanks as parsers, include --ParserNetwork input_vocab_classes=FormMultivocab:UPOSTokenVocab:XPOSFeatureVocab:UFeatsFeatureVocab:LemmaTokenVocab

# Note that `XPOSTokenVocab` has been replaced with `XPOSFeatureVocab`!
# There are other treebanks with composite XPOS tags but they're variable-length lists rather than dicts (like UFeats) or fixed-length vectors (like these)
